## Future Plan
* Certainly, this Dashboard is still in a very preliminary stage, and several improvements could be made, including but not limited to:

	* The need for a clear business understanding to better customize the usage purposes of the Dashboard.
	* Understanding what resources the business can provide, including any existing cloud services (SQL, AWS, or Google Cloud) or other resources that can be utilized.
	* A need for a better architectural design for the Dashboard, encompassing the frontend, backend, and database systems.
	* Scalability is crucial to handle heavy usage for future needs.
	* For the output datasets, further data cleaning and transformation are required to convert the raw data into a clean dataset.
